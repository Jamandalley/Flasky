Flasky
======

This repository contains the modified source code examples for the second edition of O'Reilly book [Flask Web Development](http://www.flaskbook.com) published by Miguel Grinberg.


The requirements.txt contains the packages for the optimised code.
The major change implemented is the use of `jwt` library for token generation and user authorization.
